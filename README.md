# Kala (Technical Documentation)

A new simple booking platform for performing arts

## Technology Stack

Why did I choose these technologies?

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) : Fast to run an make app out of, just gorgeous
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) : Simple and easy to use, and free

## Design

To account for the strict deadlines, no code refactoring was done (So beware if you decide to look through the code). There are some comments though :)

## User Flows

### Booking

- They enter the explore view
